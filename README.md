# Compiler Design and Implementation
## Description
This project focused on designing and implementing key compiler components in the C programming language to build a comprehensive compiler system. Lexical analysis was handled using Lex (Flex), while parsing was performed with YACC (Bison). The goal was to develop a collection of modules that executed lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, and code optimization, providing a solid foundation for a functional compiler.
